## ✨ Features

## 🚀 The Eisenhower Principle

The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Important & Urgent**: Tasks that need immediate attention
2. **Important & Not Urgent**: Tasks to schedule and complete personally
3. **Not Important & Urgent**: Tasks to delegate when possible
4. **Not Important & Not Urgent**: Tasks to minimize or eliminate

2. Add tasks to the appropriate quadrant
3. Double-click tasks to edit
4. Drag tasks between quadrants to reprioritize
5. Return anytime to see your task matrix - all data is saved locally
